Goal:
- Have a ML model that can predict the ~vibes~ from audio data

Steps:
1. Get spotirip to work
2. Integrate dataset with spotirip
3. Make wav dataset with 30 second clips
3.1 Consider getting dataset with full songs
4. Ideally use pretrained model - then do transfer learning

Next Steps:
1. Make a 2nd database - with my own choice of songs
2. Retrain and see results
3. Window songs into clips and then predict labels
4. manually fix labels?
5. Test
6. repeat
7. profit
